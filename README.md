## Setup 
- Quick Intros, workshop agenda
- Setup (5 min!) 
  - Download code, open in editor of choice (I'm using VSCode, but have also tried [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Both are good options!)
  - Start a local server. There are several ways to do this! 
    - Some text editors have external packages you can download so you can start a server directly within your editor (e.g., Atom Live Server)
    - If you want to do this in Terminal, `cd` into wherever you downloaded the code, and run the following: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3333```

    - See this [documentation](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server) for more information.
